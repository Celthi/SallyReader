Script to back up my reading

Someday, the learning portal will be closed. And there are a lot of books that I have read. So I write this script to back up some of the books.

Currently, it is aimed at my personal usage, so it won't run in your computer unless you change some of the settings.


Written by Typescript.

TODO

- [ ] resolve the http2 error after download some images.
- [ ] Maybe use password instead of cookie.
